List password entries, search for username, get username and password using [Secret Service API](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/secret-service).

The default collection (service) in Secret Service is used, this is normally the login collection.
On at least Ubuntu this collection is by default open when a user is logged in. So there is no
need to enter a master password to unlock the collection.
